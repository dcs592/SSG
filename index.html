		Deriving its name from the beautiful park in Dublin, St. Stephen’s Green brings awareness to Irish music with a repertoire spanning modern Irish rock while still paying tribute to traditional Irish folk and songs of rebellion. As friends who had played music together for years, Matt and Rob started the band to bring a fresh perspective to Irish music to the Chicago-land area. By blending a female’s voice over the harmony of mandolin, guitar, and bass, St. Stephen’s Green does just that.
		</p><p>
		St. Stephen’s Green borrows and modifies songs old and new; some influences include The Dubliners, The Pogues, The Saw Doctors, U2, and the Wild Colonial Bhoys. The band is always looking for Irish songs to add to the set list.
		</p><p>
		The band is being booked frequently in the Chicago area, and seeks venues in downstate Illinois and throughout the Midwest. Wherever an audience is interested in Irish music, St. Stephen’s Green is ready to play.</p></div>

		<h3 style="color: #009933; text-align: center">Vocals / Flute</h3>
		<div class="description2">Liz was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. From a young age, Liz enjoyed performing and would often sing in her church’s youth choir. In 2004, she travelled to Galway and Dublin, and fell in love with Irish culture. By chance, she met Matt in 2014, and joined the lineup of St. Stephen’s Green shortly after. Liz provides the unique vocal sound and talent that Matt and Rob envisioned.</div>

		<h3 style="color: #009933; text-align: center">Lead Guitar</h3>
		<div class="description3">Rob grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where he started playing guitar when he was 12 years old. He played in various music projects, including rock, blues, motown, and dusties. He has Irish roots from both of his parents (his grandma on his mom’s side has the maiden name Murphy). His family’s roots can be traced back to County Cork in Ireland. Rob plays the lead guitar in SSG.</div>

		<div class="description2">Dane grew up in rural Illinois before moving to Chicago in 2010. Although he started learning to play music at age 11, he was 17 before he bought his first guitar; months later he became lead guitarist in a Beatles-cover band. Over the years he has acquired a major interest in Bob Dylan, as well as many musicians of the American and Irish folk tradition. Dane the traditional sound to St. Stephen's Green with the banjo and mandolin.</div>

		<h3 style="color: #009933; text-align: center">Bass Guitar / Guitar / Harmonica</h3>
		<div class="description3">Matt is also from the South Side of Chicago, but takes pride in his heritage from Westport, County Mayo, Ireland. He has been playing the guitar since 18, and has been most influenced by The Beatles, Oasis, The Pogues, and Saw Doctors. His dream of starting an Irish band was realized in 2014, when he collaborated with longtime friend Rob to lay the foundation. When he is not playing the bass and acoustic guitar with St. Stephen's Green, he is probably playing rugby.</div>
