			<p>Saturday, March 11, the amazing Wild Colonial Bhoys will join SSG for a show for St. Germain Parish in Oak Lawn, IL.</p>

			<p>SSG has known Adam Coolong and the Wild Colonial Bhoys since March in 2015, when they performed at Ballydoyle Irish Pub in Downer's Grove, IL. As they have for years, the Wild Colonial Bhoys performed an incredible show, full of thought, reverence, and immense talent.</p>

			<p>In the summer of 2016, Adam helped SSG record and produce its first album, "Need Not Apply." His knowledge of music, sound, and the industry was invaluable throughout the experience.</p>

			<p>SSG is extraordinarily excited to share the stage with the Wild Colonial Bhoys, who will play following SSG from 10:30 to midnight on Saturday. See you there!</p>

For those who do, this will simply be a new, very unique take on some tried and true Irish favorites! </p>

			<p>Need Not Apply will be here just in time for the Halfway to St. Patrick's Day celebrations! It will be available on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and many other sites. You can also purchase physical CDs and tshirts at our shows!</p>

			<p>SSG would like to thank Adam Coolong--frontman of the Wild Colonial Bhoys and sound engineer for Varsity Audio, Inc.--for producing, recording, mixing, and mastering this album. We could not have asked for a more professional and quality service!</p>

			<p>SSG has a long lineup of shows in March and will be using the opportunity to showcase all of the changes that have happened since the band kicked off a year ago. First we'll be hitting up Kenny's Irish Pub on 3/5, following their St. Patrick's Day parade. Then we'll revisit Reilly's Daughter in Oak Lawn, The Square Celt Ale House in Orland Park, and Palmer Place. All of these venues have hosted us before and audiences may be surprised by our newer Irish sound. Unlike last year, we now have Tony bringing those sad Irish ballads to life and adding fire to the angry rebellion songs with his drum set. </p>

			<p>This will also be the first time playing with Rick Greenfield, our newest member. Rick plays the fiddle. The addition of his traditional Irish instrument adds a folky layering that every Irish song needs. We're are excited to have him join us on stage!</p>

			<p>Join us starting March 5! Visit our schedule page to see the full list of events, times, and details. Then call your friends and come out for a good time!</p></div>

			<p>On Sunday, October 11, 2015, The High Kings brought their amazing and unique take on Irish music back to Chicago, and St. Stephen’s Green could not resist going to the show. Every member of The High Kings brings amazing talent vocally and instrumentally and makes every performance incredible, including Sunday’s show. After the show, SSG made sure to meet up with The High Kings at the autograph table to introduce the band and get a picture together. They were especially friendly and kind, true gentlemen representing Irish culture in the best way possible.</p>

			<p>St. Stephen’s Green would not be where it is without The High Kings. While SSG does play some of The High King’s songs, it is the unique style that has been the greatest influence. The instrumental layering, the upbeat cheerfulness that even pervades Ireland’s saddest ballads, and the twists on traditional songs through interesting break strains and slow or fast verses; these are just a few of things The High Kings have brought to the genre, and SSG gladly takes up the style to help spread the Irish culture.</p>

			<p>Thank you to The High Kings! We wish you continued and increasing success around the world!</p></div>
